# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction Using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes, based on medical data. It compares the performance of **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** models, evaluates them using multiple metrics, and provides an interface for user input predictions.
